# The stack for this project will involve the following:

1) DynamoDB for database
2) AWS Lambda for backend
3) Netlify for frontend deployment
4) S3 for file/image hosting
5) Cloudinary for image hosting
6) IFTTT to webhook for cron
7) RedisLabs for queues & cache
8) Figma for designing and prototyping
9) Porkbun for $6.com domains
10) Cloudflare for DNS

First, a frontend website and UI design describing the project goal and business vision needs to be built and deployed first. 
I will be using a React frontend with bootstrap design.

Private repos and documentation providing specs, feature ideas, architecture, and user stories will continue to be added privately on a Google Drive until further notice.
